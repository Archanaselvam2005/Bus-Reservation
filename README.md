# 🚌 Bus Reservation System – Java Console Application

This is a **Java-based console application** for booking bus tickets. It uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and connects to a **MySQL database using JDBC** to manage bus seat availability, passenger bookings, and travel dates.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Book tickets with passenger name, bus number, and travel date
- Check real-time **seat availability** using bus capacity and existing bookings
- **Date input parsing** with error handling
- Follows modular design with `Booking`, `busDAO`, and `BookingDAO` classes
- Uses **JDBC** for MySQL database connectivity

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Java OOP (classes, constructors, encapsulation)
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- Scanner for user input
- `SimpleDateFormat` for date parsing
- SQL queries to fetch bus capacity and current bookings
